1. I chose a variance of 1 for each gausian distribution bandit arm as it simplifies the model and does not assume an overly complex problem plane. Randomizing the variance can result in needing much
more training steps and could not converge to a solution. A value for variances of 1 indicates that most of the samples in the distribution will be centered around 2 units away from the mean which is a standart value I think and is sufficient for the
task because its simple enough.

Through running a simulation of n=100, k=10, t=100 starting at epsilon = 0.01 and incrementing epsilon by 0.01 each round for 100 different experiments and averaging the number of pulls
made from the highest potential bandit arm the best value to pick for epsilon was 3.4

Benchmarking variables 
t= 500, n=100, k=5, step = 0.1
